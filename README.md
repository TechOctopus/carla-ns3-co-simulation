# Installation Guide

CARLA-NS3-co-simulation consists of three main components:

1.  **CARLA:** An autonomous driving simulator that provides a Python API for controlling vehicles and interacting with the virtual environment.
2.  **NS3:** A network simulator designed for modeling network interactions.
3.  **CARLA-NS3-co-simulation:** An interface that enables interaction and synchronization between CARLA and NS3.

## Step 1: Install CARLA

The first step is to install the CARLA simulator. This guide requires CARLA version 0.9.15. If you already have this version installed, you can skip this step. If you have a different version, you may need to reinstall CARLA or ensure compatibility with the co-simulation interface.

Detailed installation instructions for CARLA are available in the official documentation: [CARLA 0.9.15 Quick Start](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.15/start_quickstart/#carla-installation).

Ensure you have installed all necessary dependencies and successfully built CARLA according to the official documentation. You can install CARLA in any directory, but using `~/carla` is recommended for convenience.

**Example of launching CARLA:**

After successful installation, navigate to the CARLA directory and execute the command:

```bash
./CarlaUE4.sh
```

## Step 2: Install NS3 with CARLA-NS3-co-simulation modules

After installing and verifying CARLA, you can proceed to set up the co-simulation interface and NS3.

1.  **Clone the CARLA-NS3-co-simulation repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:TechOctopus/carla-ns3-co-simulation.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd carla-ns3-co-simulation
    ```

3.  **Install system dependencies for NS3:**

    - This step is typically performed **only once** when first installing NS3 on your system.

    ```bash
    sudo ./installdependencies.sh
    ```

4.  **Install NS3 and required modules:**
    - This script will download and build NS3, and integrate the necessary components for co-simulation. This process may take some time.
    ```bash
    ./install_ns3.sh
    ```
    Upon completion, you should see messages confirming successful execution:
    ```bash
    ...
    "[INFO] ns-3 downloaded and unpacked"
    ...
    "[INFO] copied bridge code to ns-3"
    ...
    "[INFO] ns-3 installation completed"
    ```

## Step 3: Set up the Python Environment

To run the co-simulation scripts, you need to set up an isolated Python environment and install the dependencies. The guide use virtual environments to manage Python packages but you can also use Anaconda or other package managers if preferred.

5.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**

    - Using a virtual environment is recommended to isolate project dependencies.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv carla
    ```

6.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - After activation, your command prompt should change to indicate the active environment (`(carla)`).

    ```bash
    source carla/bin/activate
    ```

7.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Installation Complete

After completing all steps, the CARLA-NS3-co-simulation system is ready for use. You have installed CARLA, NS3 with the necessary modules, and configured the Python environment with all dependencies.
